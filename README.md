This Repo will nake you to understand difference between scalar , vector and matrix and tensors and Use of tensors for developing Deep learning models:

Entire coding part were done by taking the reference from PyTorch official documentation.If facing any issue with my code you can find it in the official documentation which mentioned below:

## Autograd

To built an Neural Networks we have both forword layer and backword layer 
since in the back-propagation we are going to update the weights of each weight using chain 
rule reaction and with derivaties concept 

For Example : 

- y = 3 * a ** 2 know if we apply derivative(y) w.r.t a for above equation we will get 

- 6 * a =  we can update the value for weight using this gradient function.

For Better Example You can follow the documentation in Pytorch.

## Running Tests




To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  since code was returned on Jupyter notebook we can take help of RUN option 
```


import torch 

and we can import Modules from the torch Library when we require
